# Products Folder

This folder contains all the files and resources related to the products in the e-commerce application. It serves as the central location for managing product-related data, assets, and scripts.

## Purpose

The `products` folder is designed to organize and store all resources required for handling product information in the e-commerce platform. This includes:

- **Product Data**: Structured data files (e.g., JSON, CSV) containing product details such as names, prices, descriptions, and categories.
- **Media Assets**: Images, videos, or other media files associated with products.
- **Scripts**: Code for processing, importing, or exporting product data.

## Folder Structure

The folder is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains product data files in formats like JSON or CSV.
- **`images/`**: Stores product images and other media assets.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes scripts for managing product data, such as import/export utilities or data transformation scripts.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route files for handling product-related API endpoints.

## Routes Folder

The `routes` folder is responsible for defining API endpoints related to products. These routes handle requests such as:

- Fetching product details.
- Adding new products.
- Updating or deleting existing products.

### Example Routes

- **GET `/products`**: Retrieve a list of all products.
- **POST `/products`**: Add a new product to the database.
- **PUT `/products/:id`**: Update details of a specific product.
- **DELETE `/products/:id`**: Remove a product from the database.

Ensure that all route files in this folder follow the application's routing conventions and are properly documented.

## Usage

1. **Adding Product Data**:

   - Place new product data files in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the data follows the required schema for the application.

2. **Adding Product Images**:

   - Save product images in the `images/` directory.
   - Use descriptive filenames to match the product they represent.

3. **Running Scripts**:
   - Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and execute the desired script.
   - Example: `node importProducts.js` (if using Node.js).

## Notes

- Always back up the `products` folder before making significant changes.
- Ensure media files are optimized for web usage to reduce load times.

Feel free to reach out to the project maintainers if you have any questions or need assistance with this folder.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while working with the `products` folder, consider the following:

1. **Missing Data**:

   - Ensure the required data files are present in the `data/` directory.
   - Verify the data schema matches the application's requirements.

2. **Broken Images**:

   - Check that the image files exist in the `images/` directory.
   - Confirm the file paths in the application match the image locations.

3. **Script Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies for the scripts in the `scripts/` directory are installed.
   - Run the scripts in the correct environment (e.g., Node.js for JavaScript scripts).
